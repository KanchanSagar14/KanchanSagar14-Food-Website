<h3>  Coca-Cola, United States </h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Coca-Cola.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>Invented by a pharmacist as a remedy to headaches in 1886, the world's most popular carbonated soft drink is like the American dream in a can -- from nothing, 85 eight-ounce cans of Coke were consumed globally per capita in 2008 -- more than any other soda. The drink has gone through various manifestations, including Diet, Cherry, Lemon and Zero, but it's the original, with a brain-freezing, nasal-passage-penetrating kick that keeps 'em coming back for more.</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3> Coffee, Ethiopia </h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Coffee.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>There's a reason coffee, said to have been discovered in Ethiopia, is one of the world's most traded commodities -- Monday mornings happen to all of us. This little green bean arguably deserves more than one entry in this list, but for all the various modes of ingestion -- latte, cappuccino, mocha, American --- you only need to know one thing to start your day off well -- there's more where it came from.</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3> Beer, Global</h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Beer.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>Sure, the wheel was a great invention; so too the computer chip. But they don't go nearly as well with pizza. Whichever trooper first had the courage to drink steeped and fermented barley had to be a bit of a loose cannon, but thanks to him or her we now have such luminary beverages as Kronenbourg 1664, Weihenstephaner Vitus (winner of World's Best Beer) and the unforgettable Santa's Butt Porter, all of which are, as Homer Simpson puts it, "the cause of and solution to all life's problems!"</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3>Tea, Global</h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Tea.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>In Tibet the butter version keeps cold bodies warm and lips chap-free. In India it provides a sugary boost and a break from street chaos. In Japan it's consumed in an elaborate ritual. In the UK it's accorded magic potion status. Nothing seems quite so bad when you hear the words, "What you need is a nice cup of tea." There's no arguing with the world's second-most widely consumed drink (after water).</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3> Air Mata Kucing, Malaysia</h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Air Mata Kucing.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>Malaysians have figured out the golden formula for making a delicious drink -- make it sweet, cold and toss in some tropical fruits. Air mata kucing, or longan drink, is exactly that. Sweetened by rock sugar and dried longan, it also comes with winter melon and a cheap price tag.</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3> Orange Juice, United States </h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Orange Juice.jpg" class="image2"></a>  Juice
<p>O.J. earns a spot on our list just for reminding us of our childhoods. The refreshing, tangy, wholesome drink, first mass-produced and distributed in the United States around 1915, has always reigned king over its try-hard cousins, apple, watermelon, pineapple and tomato.</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3> Red Wine, Global </h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Red Wine.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>What sound does a fermented grape make? None, it just lets out a little wine. And thank God for that. Or rather, thank the Georgians. The region in what is now known as Eurasia is credited with the first wine production 8,000 years ago. Thanks to them we now have such enjoyable pairings as beef and Merlot, tuna and Pinot Noir.</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3>Gin And Tonic, England</h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Gin And Tonic.jpg" class="image2"></a> 
<p>Trust the Brits to make a medicine (the quinine in tonic water was used by the British East India Company to prevent malaria) more palatable by throwing in some booze. Still, we're glad they did, as the clink-clink, glug-glug, fizzzz of a gin and tonic being poured is about as perfect an introduction to a balmy evening as it's possible to find.</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3> Hot Chocolate With Marshmallows, United States</h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Hot Chocolate With Marshmallows.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>If pina colada equals tropical beaches, then hot chocolate with marshmallows equals extra-thick mitten socks and couch loafing inside ski resorts. This drink is your only legitimate excuse to stay indoors when in the Alps. The rich and aromatic hot chocolate also makes gloomy winter mornings worth looking forward to.</p></div></div>
<div class="column">
		<div class="cards">
			<h3> Sangria, Spain </h3>
<a href="">
<img src="images/Sangria.jpg" class="image2"></a>
<p>So your parents-in-law pay you a surprise visit, and all you've got in the cupboard is a cheap bottle of red and some half-rotten fruits. Not to worry. The Spanish came up with sangria, a sweet, carbonated wine punch that has entertained guests from all nations. Splash some brandy over it to bring out that spicy kick.</p></div></div></div>
