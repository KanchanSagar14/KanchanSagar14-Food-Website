<h1>  Soupe a l'oignon, France </h1>
<br><br><br>
<center><div class="card">
<p> This is a traditional French soup made of onions and beef stock, usually served with croutons and melted cheese on top. Dating back to Roman times, this was traditionally a peasant dish although the current version dates from the 18th century.</p><br>

</br><p>The soup's unique flavor comes from the caramelization of the onions, which often have brandy or sherry added during the slow-cooking process. If you're in a soup mood, why not try Marseille's traditional soupe de poisson a la rouille. Once a fisherman's favorite, this soup is characterized by a dollop of garlic and saffron mayonnaise placed on top. </p>
